# CurrencyGetBot

### Idea
I decided to create this bot in order to track the exchange rate between the **EURO** & **Moroccan Dirham**. 

My idea is to retrieve data in real time from an International Money Transfer agency using _Selenium_. Which is an open-source web-based automation tool. 

# Requirements
- Google Chrome 84
# How to execute the code
- source env/bin/activate
- python3 SHeadless.py
